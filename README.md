**Deprecated, prettier now support formatting vue files natively**

Usage:
  You can run it without args and it will use the current
  directory as base and look for a .prettierrc file to use
  as prettier config and .vue files inside a ./src folder.
  You can change this behavior with the following options:
```
  (command)   (default)
  
  --baseDir  'process.cwd()'
    Change path used as base for config and root paths

  --rootDir   './src'
    Change dir where .vue files will be searched

  --noisy     false
    Wether to print the path of files being formatted

  --help|-h
    Show this help
```
